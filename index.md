**Attacks on Women's Rights in Poland: 2020-2022**  

Hello! My name is Aleksandra Maciocha, Alex for short. This page is dedicated to spread awareness on the women's rights movement in Poland, which has been actively protesting heavier law restrictions considering abortion. On this website I will present a timeline of the more recent protests, when the tension between the people and the government is more intense than ever.

I am a student in the Sociology department at University of Essex. My course (Communications and Digital Culture) focuses mainly on how digital media shape and affect our society. This is my second year of studying on this course, and throughout this time I have found a great interest in the women's and LGBTQ+A rights movements all over the world. Since my nationality is Polish, this case specifically is a very personal hit. I try to spread awareness on Polish women's everyday struggles every chance I get.

## Introduction
I wish this project had nothing to do with politics, however unfortunately, it does. Women's rights have not been respected by the society in the past, mostly due to division in power between genders that has been created under various, ever-changing circumstances. Throughout the years, the value of women and their rights have been constantly diminished and regarded as lesser than men's. It went on for so long, that it seemed like only law could impose new ways of treating women, based on respect and having their safety and comfort as a priority. Shockingly, this is a fairly new change in laws all over the world and that is why in some countries it is still not fully imposed. In the case of Poland, the recent history of women's rights has been quite chaotic. Untill the biggest right-wing political party has won its first election back in 2015, women have been gaining more and more freedom. Unfortunately, the conservative party, which has been consistently rulling in Poland since 2015, has been actively trying to limit women's rights and have used the need of preservation of religious values as an excuse for doing so.
